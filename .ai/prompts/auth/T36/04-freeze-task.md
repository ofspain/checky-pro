<!-- MODEL: Human Approval — Phase 4 (Freeze Task Brief). Sonnet is the default working model; escalate to Opus/Fable ONLY when a phase needs architectural reasoning beyond the frozen brief. Kimi 2.7 runs the adversarial review phases (3, 8, 11). Human Approval gates (4, 9) are decisions, not model runs. -->

# auth · T36 · Phase 4 — Freeze Task Brief

| | |
|---|---|
| **Service** | `auth-service` |
| **Task** | T36 — End-to-end integration test |
| **Spec section** | Final verification |
| **Model** | Human Approval |
| **Consumes** | `artifacts/03-design-challenge.md` |
| **Produces** | `artifacts/04-frozen-task-brief.md` (write it here; exactly one artifact) |

**Task statement (verbatim from `spec/auth-service/tasks.md`, task 36):**
> **End-to-end integration test.** Using Testcontainers Postgres+Kafka, execute: register → verify email → login (password) → admin assigns MERCHANT → next login requires MFA enrollment → enroll TOTP → login with TOTP → create API key → exchange key for JWT → call session list → revoke session.

**Spec package:** `spec/auth-service/` → `package.md` · `requirements.md` · `design.md` · `tasks.md` · `agents.md`

- **Scoped requirement IDs:** `R1`, `R4`, `R24`, `R30`, `R31`, `R36`
- **Scoped LOCKED decisions:** none — no LOCKED decision constrains this task
- **Named tests (`package.md` §8):** `shouldConformToAuthOpenApiContract`
- **Contracts:** `contracts/api/auth.yaml`, `contracts/api/token-claims.md`, `contracts/events/auth/email-requested.v1.schema.json`, `contracts/events/auth/security-audit.v1.schema.json`
- **Standing rules:** `spec/auth-service/agents.md` is authoritative — never restate or violate it.

---

**Human Approval gate.** Consume the Phase 2 TIB and the Phase 3 challenge. A human (not the model) decides. The model's job is only to assemble the decision packet:
- Fold each ACCEPTED Phase 3 amendment into the brief; list each REJECTED one with a reason.
- Confirm every Open Question is resolved or explicitly deferred with an owner.
- Confirm scope, Files-to-Create/Modify/NOT-Modify, and acceptance criteria are final.

Write the **frozen brief** to the artifact and mark it `STATUS: FROZEN`. Downstream phases may not renegotiate it. If the human does not approve, stop — do not advance.
---

## Guardrails (apply to every phase)
- Work ONLY on **T36**. Ignore every other task in the package.
- No unrelated refactoring. No speculative improvements. No scope beyond this task.
- Obey every LOCKED decision and `agents.md`. If one looks wrong, STOP and log it under Open Questions — never deviate silently.
- Never modify the specification files under `spec/`.
- Reference documents; do not paste whole specs into the artifact.
- Produce exactly one artifact: `artifacts/04-frozen-task-brief.md`. This is a **Human Approval gate** — a person makes the decision. The model only assembles the material for review; it does not advance the pipeline itself.
