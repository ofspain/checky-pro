<!-- MODEL: Claude Sonnet — Phase 5 (Implementation Plan). Sonnet is the default working model; escalate to Opus/Fable ONLY when a phase needs architectural reasoning beyond the frozen brief. Kimi 2.7 runs the adversarial review phases (3, 8, 11). Human Approval gates (4, 9) are decisions, not model runs. -->

# auth · T11 · Phase 5 — Implementation Plan

| | |
|---|---|
| **Service** | `auth-service` |
| **Task** | T11 — Lockout state machine |
| **Spec section** | Lockout and authentication |
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet |
| **Consumes** | `artifacts/04-frozen-task-brief.md` |
| **Produces** | `artifacts/05-implementation-plan.md` (write it here; exactly one artifact) |

**Task statement (verbatim from `spec/auth-service/tasks.md`, task 11):**
> **Lockout state machine.** Implement `LockoutStateMachine` with the 5-attempt / 30-min / 15-min rules. Unit-test boundaries.

**Spec package:** `spec/auth-service/` → `package.md` · `requirements.md` · `design.md` · `tasks.md` · `agents.md`

- **Scoped requirement IDs:** `R16`, `R17`, `R18`, `R19`
- **Scoped LOCKED decisions:** `L4`
- **Named tests (`package.md` §8):** `shouldLockAccountAfterFiveFailedAttemptsWithinThirtyMinutes`, `shouldResetLockoutCounterOnSuccessfulLogin`
- **Contracts:** `contracts/api/auth.yaml`, `contracts/api/token-claims.md`, `contracts/events/auth/email-requested.v1.schema.json`, `contracts/events/auth/security-audit.v1.schema.json`
- **Standing rules:** `spec/auth-service/agents.md` is authoritative — never restate or violate it.

---

Consume the frozen brief (Phase 4). Plan the implementation — **do NOT write code.**

Return: Files to create · Files to modify · Public methods (signatures) · Private methods · Entities used · Repositories used · Services used · Unit/integration tests required · **Execution order** (front-load schema/migration, then dao, service, api, tests).

Every planned file must trace to the frozen brief's Files sections. Do not add files the brief does not authorize.
---

## Guardrails (apply to every phase)
- Work ONLY on **T11**. Ignore every other task in the package.
- No unrelated refactoring. No speculative improvements. No scope beyond this task.
- Obey every LOCKED decision and `agents.md`. If one looks wrong, STOP and log it under Open Questions — never deviate silently.
- Never modify the specification files under `spec/`.
- Reference documents; do not paste whole specs into the artifact.
- Produce exactly one artifact: `artifacts/05-implementation-plan.md`. Do this phase's work, write the one artifact, then STOP and wait.
