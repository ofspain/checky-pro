<!-- MODEL: Claude Sonnet — Phase 12 (Specification Verification). Sonnet is the default working model; escalate to Opus/Fable ONLY when a phase needs architectural reasoning beyond the frozen brief. Kimi 2.7 runs the adversarial review phases (3, 8, 11). Human Approval gates (4, 9) are decisions, not model runs. -->

# notification · T08 · Phase 12 — Specification Verification

| | |
|---|---|
| **Service** | `notification-service` |
| **Task** | T08 — Preference resolver |
| **Spec section** | Preferences, rendering, delivery |
| **Model** | Claude Sonnet |
| **Consumes** | `artifacts/11-test-review.md` |
| **Produces** | `artifacts/12-specification-verification.md` (write it here; exactly one artifact) |

**Task statement (verbatim from `spec/notification-service/tasks.md`, task 8):**
> **Preference resolver.** Implement `ChannelPreference` + `PreferenceResolver` honouring opt-outs and applying the documented default when none is set (L6, R9/R10/R18). Enforce that SECURITY-category email cannot be disabled.

**Spec package:** `spec/notification-service/` → `package.md` · `requirements.md` · `design.md` · `tasks.md` · `agents.md`

- **Scoped requirement IDs:** `R9`, `R10`, `R18`
- **Scoped LOCKED decisions:** `L6`
- **Named tests (`package.md` §8):** `shouldResolveChannelPreferencesPerRecipient`, `shouldSuppressChannelWhenRecipientOptedOut`, `shouldFallBackToDefaultPreferenceWhenNoneSet`
- **Contracts:** `contracts/events/`, `contracts/events/*`, `contracts/events/notifications/*`
- **Standing rules:** `spec/notification-service/agents.md` is authoritative — never restate or violate it.

---

Consume all prior artifacts. Compare the final implementation and tests against `requirements.md`, `design.md`, and `tasks.md` for THIS task. Produce a **traceability matrix** with columns: `Requirement | Implemented? | Evidence (file:line) | Test? | Missing? | Deviation?`.

Then, as the approving principal engineer, answer: (1) Is the task fully complete? (2) Does it satisfy every acceptance criterion? (3) Does it violate any LOCKED decision? (4) Remaining risks? End with a single verdict line: **PASS** or **FAIL**, with a one-line reason.
---

## Guardrails (apply to every phase)
- Work ONLY on **T08**. Ignore every other task in the package.
- No unrelated refactoring. No speculative improvements. No scope beyond this task.
- Obey every LOCKED decision and `agents.md`. If one looks wrong, STOP and log it under Open Questions — never deviate silently.
- Never modify the specification files under `spec/`.
- Reference documents; do not paste whole specs into the artifact.
- Produce exactly one artifact: `artifacts/12-specification-verification.md`. Do this phase's work, write the one artifact, then STOP and wait.
